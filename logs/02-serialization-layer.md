# Implementation Log: 02 - Serialization Layer (`omniq.serialization`)

**Date:** 2025-07-14

## Summary

This implementation step focused on creating the serialization layer for the OmniQ library. This layer is responsible for converting Python objects into a byte stream for storage or transmission, and vice versa.

## Changes

- Created the `src/omniq/serialization` directory.
- Added the `dill` dependency for serializing complex Python objects.
- Implemented a `SerializationManager` that uses a dual-serializer strategy:
    - `MsgspecSerializer`: For high-performance serialization of `msgspec`-compatible types.
    - `DillSerializer`: As a fallback for more complex Python objects that `msgspec` cannot handle.
- This approach provides both performance and flexibility, automatically choosing the best serializer for the job.

## Next Steps

The next step is to define the abstract base classes for the storage interfaces. These interfaces will define the contract for all storage backends, ensuring a consistent API for the rest of the library.
