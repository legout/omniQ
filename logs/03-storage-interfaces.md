# Implementation Log: 03 - Storage Interfaces (`omniq.storage.base`)

**Date:** 2025-07-14

## Summary

This implementation step focused on defining the abstract base classes for the storage layer. These interfaces establish a clear contract for all storage backends, ensuring a consistent API for interacting with task queues, result storage, and event storage.

## Changes

- Created the `src/omniq/storage` directory.
- Implemented the following abstract base classes in `src/omniq/storage/base.py`:
    - `BaseTaskQueue`: Defines the core methods for enqueuing, dequeuing, and retrieving tasks.
    - `BaseResultStorage`: Defines the methods for setting and retrieving task results.
    - `BaseEventStorage`: Defines the methods for logging and retrieving task lifecycle events.
- Each interface includes both synchronous and asynchronous method definitions to support the "Async First, Sync Wrapped" architecture.

## Next Steps

The next step is to build the configuration system, which will allow users to configure the OmniQ library and its components using various methods, including environment variables, YAML files, and Python objects.
