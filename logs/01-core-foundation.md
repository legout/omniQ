# Implementation Log: 01 - Core Foundation (`omniq.models`)

**Date:** 2025-07-14

## Summary

This implementation step focused on creating the core data models for the OmniQ library. These models are the foundation for all other components and define the structure of tasks, schedules, results, events, and configuration.

## Changes

- Created the `src/omniq/models` directory.
- Added the `msgspec` dependency for high-performance data serialization.
- Added the `croniter` and `python-dateutil` dependencies for task scheduling.
- Implemented the following data models using `msgspec.Struct`:
    - `Task`: Represents a task to be executed, including its metadata, dependencies, and callbacks.
    - `Schedule`: Defines the schedule for a recurring task, supporting both cron-style and interval-based scheduling.
    - `TaskResult`: Stores the outcome of a task execution.
    - `TaskEvent`: Represents a lifecycle event of a task for logging and monitoring.
    - `OmniQConfig` and related configuration models: Defines the structure for configuring the OmniQ library and its components.

## Next Steps

The next step is to implement the serialization layer, which will handle the conversion of these models to and from a format suitable for storage and transmission.
