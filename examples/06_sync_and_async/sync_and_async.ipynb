    "This notebook demonstrated how OmniQ seamlessly handles both synchronous and asynchronous tasks:\n",

    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Automatic Detection**: OmniQ automatically detects whether a task is sync or async\n",
    "2. **Worker Flexibility**: Both AsyncWorker and ThreadWorker can handle mixed workloads\n",
    "3. **Performance**: Different workers may perform better depending on the workload characteristics\n",
    "4. **Ease of Use**: No special configuration needed - just enqueue tasks and let OmniQ handle the execution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Worker Behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AsyncWorker**: \n",
    "  - ‚úÖ Native async task execution\n",
    "  - ‚úÖ Sync tasks run in thread pools\n",
    "  - üéØ Best for I/O-heavy workloads\n",

    "  - ‚úÖ Async tasks run in new event loops\n",
    "  - üéØ Best for CPU-heavy workloads\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Try modifying the task functions to see different behaviors\n",
    "- Experiment with different worker configurations\n",
    "- Test with your own real-world sync and async functions\n",
