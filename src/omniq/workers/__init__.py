"""Worker implementations for OmniQ.

This module provides various worker implementations for executing tasks:
- BaseWorker: Abstract base class for all workers
- AsyncWorker: Core async worker implementation
- ThreadPoolWorker: Synchronous wrapper around AsyncWorker
- AsyncProcessWorker: Process-based async worker implementation
- ProcessPoolWorker: Synchronous wrapper around AsyncProcessWorker
- AsyncGeventWorker: Gevent-based async worker implementation
- GeventPoolWorker: Synchronous wrapper around AsyncGeventWorker
