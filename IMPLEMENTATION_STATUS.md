## 📋 Scheduling Usage Examples

### Cron Scheduling
```python
# Every weekday at 9 AM
schedule_id = await omniq.create_schedule(
    func="daily_report",
    schedule_type=ScheduleType.CRON,
    cron_expression="0 9 * * 1-5",
    args=("report_type",),
    kwargs={"format": "pdf"}
)
```

### Interval Scheduling
```python
# Every 30 minutes, max 100 runs
schedule_id = await omniq.create_schedule(
    func="cleanup_task",
    schedule_type=ScheduleType.INTERVAL,
    interval=timedelta(minutes=30),
    max_runs=100
)
```

### Timestamp Scheduling
```python
# One-time execution in 2 hours
schedule_id = await omniq.create_schedule(
    func="maintenance_task",
    schedule_type=ScheduleType.TIMESTAMP,
    timestamp=datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(hours=2)
)
```

### Schedule Management
```python
# Start scheduler
await omniq.start_scheduler()

# Pause/resume/cancel
await omniq.pause_schedule(schedule_id)
await omniq.resume_schedule(schedule_id)
await omniq.cancel_schedule(schedule_id)

# List and monitor
schedules = await omniq.list_schedules(status=ScheduleStatus.ACTIVE)
