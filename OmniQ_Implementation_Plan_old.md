# Revised Implementation Plan for the `OmniQ` Python Library

This plan outlines the development of `OmniQ`, a modular Python task queue library designed for both local and distributed task processing with scheduling capabilities. The goal is to create a flexible system with minimal dependencies, supporting various storage backends and fault-tolerant features.

---

## 1. Project Goals and Requirements
**Goal**: Build a task queue library that can handle tasks locally or across distributed systems, with scheduling and minimal external dependencies.

**Requirements**:
- **Storage Options**: 
  - Local options include RAM (temporary, in-memory storage), SQLite (a lightweight database), and Filesystem (file-based storage).
  - Distributed options include Redis (a fast in-memory data store), PostgreSQL (a robust relational database), and NATS (a messaging system with persistent storage features).
- **Tasks**: Support both synchronous (sequential) and asynchronous (concurrent) tasks, with serialization to handle complex Python objects.
- **Processing**: Use threading for synchronous tasks and Asyncio for asynchronous tasks, with asynchronous libraries for distributed systems.
- **Scheduling**: Allow tasks to run on fixed intervals, CRON schedules (like "every Monday at 9 AM"), or specific future times.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Automatically retry failed tasks with increasing delays to avoid system overload.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Ensure the system can recover from network issues or crashes.
- **Result Storage**: Save task outcomes for later retrieval, with a configurable expiration time.

## 2. Architecture Overview
- **Key Components**:
  - **Task**: Represents a single job with details like priority and retry settings.
  - **Schedule**: Manages when tasks should run, supporting different timing methods.
  - **Storage**: A standard interface for saving and retrieving tasks and schedules, implemented differently for each backend.
  - **TaskQueue**: The central manager that coordinates task execution and scheduling.

- **Storage Backends**:
  - Local backends store data directly on the machine, while distributed backends allow multiple machines to share tasks.
  - Each backend has unique strengths, like speed (Redis) or durability (PostgreSQL).

- **Scheduling**: A background process checks for tasks that are ready to run and queues them accordingly.

## 3. Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Define the `Task` Class
- **Description**: Create a class to represent individual tasks.
- **Context**: 
  - This class needs to track details like a unique ID, the function to run, priority level, whether it’s asynchronous, how many times it’s been retried, the maximum retries allowed, and a delay before retrying. 
  - Serialization (converting the function to a storable format) is key, as tasks may need to be saved or sent across systems.
- **Prerequisites**: None, but a serialization library will be needed.
- **Time**: 1 hour

### Task 2: Define the `Schedule` Class
- **Description**: Create a class to handle task scheduling.
- **Context**: 
  - Schedules can be set to repeat at fixed intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes), follow CRON patterns (e.g., every weekday at noon), or run once at a specific time (e.g., tomorrow at 3 PM).
  - The class will calculate the next run time and allow pausing or resuming schedules.
- **Prerequisites**: Task 1 (for task association).
- **Time**: 2 hours

### Task 3: Define the Abstract `Storage` Interface
- **Description**: Set up a blueprint for all storage backends.
- **Context**: 
  - This ensures every backend (RAM, Redis, etc.) supports the same operations, like saving a task, fetching a task, or updating a schedule.
  - It’s abstract, meaning it defines what needs to be done without specifying how.
- **Prerequisites**: Task 1 and Task 2.
- **Time**: 1 hour

### Task 4: Implement `RAMStorage` Backend
- **Description**: Build a memory-based storage option.
- **Context**: 
  - This stores everything in RAM, making it fast but temporary—data is lost when the program ends. 
  - It’s ideal for testing since it doesn’t require setup like a database.
- **Prerequisites**: Task 3.
- **Time**: 2 hours

### Task 5: Implement `SQLiteStorage` Backend
- **Description**: Build a database-backed storage option using SQLite.
- **Context**: 
  - SQLite is a simple, file-based database that keeps data even after the program stops.
  - It’s good for local use but can slow down with heavy concurrent access.
- **Prerequisites**: Task 3.
- **Time**: 3 hours

### Task 6: Implement `FileStorage` Backend
- **Description**: Build a file-based storage option.
- **Context**: 
  - This saves tasks and schedules as files on disk, offering another persistent option.
  - It’s straightforward but may not scale well for many tasks.
- **Prerequisites**: Task 3.
- **Time**: 3 hours

### Task 7: Implement `TaskQueue` Framework
- **Description**: Create the main class to manage tasks.
- **Context**: 
  - This is the heart of the system, handling task queuing, worker management (to run tasks), and result tracking.
  - It supports both threading (for simpler tasks) and Asyncio (for concurrent tasks).
- **Prerequisites**: Task 1 and Task 3.
- **Time**: 3 hours

### Task 8: Add Scheduler Logic to `TaskQueue`
- **Description**: Add scheduling capabilities to the task manager.
- **Context**: 
  - The scheduler regularly checks which schedules are due, queues their tasks, and updates the next run time for repeating schedules.
  - It ties the `Schedule` class into the `TaskQueue`.
- **Prerequisites**: Task 2 and Task 7.
- **Time**: 3 hours

### Task 9: Implement Retry Mechanism
- **Description**: Add logic to retry failed tasks.
- **Context**: 
  - If a task fails, it’s retried after a delay that increases with each attempt (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s).
  - After too many failures, it’s marked as failed permanently.
- **Prerequisites**: Task 7.
- **Time**: 2 hours

### Task 10: Implement Result Storage
- **Description**: Enable saving and retrieving task results.
- **Context**: 
  - Results (success or failure details) are stored so users can check outcomes later.
  - They’re kept for a set time (e.g., 24 hours) before cleanup.
- **Prerequisites**: Task 7.
- **Time**: 2 hours

### Task 11: Implement `RedisStorage` Backend
- **Description**: Build a distributed storage option using Redis.
- **Context**: 
  - Redis is fast and allows multiple machines to share tasks, making it great for distributed setups.
  - It requires an external Redis server running.
- **Prerequisites**: Task 3.
- **Time**: 4 hours

### Task 12: Implement `PostgresStorage` Backend
- **Description**: Build a distributed storage option using PostgreSQL.
- **Context**: 
  - PostgreSQL offers robust, reliable storage with advanced features like locking for concurrent access.
  - It’s suited for larger, more permanent systems.
- **Prerequisites**: Task 3.
- **Time**: 4 hours

### Task 13: Implement `NATSStorage` Backend
- **Description**: Build a distributed storage option using NATS.
- **Context**: 
  - NATS is a lightweight messaging system that supports task queues and metadata storage.
  - It’s designed for high-speed, distributed environments.
- **Prerequisites**: Task 3.
- **Time**: 4 hours

### Task 14: Add Fault Tolerance
- **Description**: Make the system resilient to failures.
- **Context**: 
  - This includes retrying network requests if they fail, timing out stuck tasks to avoid hangs, and logging errors for debugging.
- **Prerequisites**: Task 7 and Tasks 11-13.
- **Time**: 2 hours

### Task 15: Write Unit Tests for Classes
- **Description**: Test the core classes individually.
- **Context**: 
  - Tests ensure the `Task`, `Schedule`, and `TaskQueue` classes work as expected, covering things like serialization and scheduling logic.
- **Prerequisites**: Tasks 1, 2, and 7.
- **Time**: 3 hours

### Task 16: Write Integration Tests for Backends
- **Description**: Test the full system with each backend.
- **Context**: 
  - These tests verify that tasks flow correctly from queuing to completion across all storage options, including failure scenarios.
- **Prerequisites**: Tasks 4-6 and 11-13.
- **Time**: 4 hours

## 4. Milestones
- **Weeks 1-2**: Build the core (`Task`, `Schedule`, `RAMStorage`, `TaskQueue`).
- **Week 3**: Add local storage options (SQLite, Filesystem).
- **Week 4**: Add scheduling, retries, and result storage.
- **Weeks 5-6**: Add distributed storage options (Redis, PostgreSQL, NATS).
- **Week 7**: Finalize with fault tolerance and testing.

## 5. Additional Notes
- **Security**: Be cautious with serialization, as it could run unintended code—consider restrictions or verification.
- **Future Ideas**: Add task dependencies or monitoring tools later.

This revised plan provides a clear roadmap with added context to guide implementation while keeping it concise and focused.
