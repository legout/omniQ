This guide provides instructions on how to install `omniq`.

## Prerequisites

Before you install `omniq`, please ensure you have the following prerequisites met:

*   **Python:** `omniq` requires Python 3.13 or higher. You can check your Python version by running:
    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

## Installation with pip

You can install `omniq` directly from the Python Package Index (PyPI) using `pip`:

```bash
pip install omniq
```

We recommend installing `omniq` in a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other packages.

### Using a Virtual Environment

1.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

2.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    *   **On macOS and Linux:**
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  **Install `omniq`:**
    ```bash
    pip install omniq
    ```

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues you might encounter during installation and how to resolve them.

### `pip` not found

If you get an error like `command not found: pip`, it means `pip` is not in your system's PATH. You can try using `python -m pip` instead:

```bash
python -m pip install omniq
```

### Old version of `pip`

An outdated version of `pip` might cause issues. You can upgrade `pip` using the following command:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Permission Errors

If you encounter permission errors during installation, you might be trying to install the package globally without sufficient privileges.
Using a virtual environment, as described above, is the recommended way to avoid this. Alternatively, you can use the `--user` flag to install the package for your user only:

```bash
pip install --user omniq
